## Installation
[To be filled out]

## Usage
### Installing Dependencies
Dependencies are defined in `requirements.txt` via flexible pinning (i.e. using `>=` rather than `==`). Running `update-deps.sh` updates therequirementsin`requirements.lock` as fixed pins on the latest version number using `pip`, unless the version number is already fixed in `requirements.txt`. Using `pip install -r requirements.lock` is thus preferred.
