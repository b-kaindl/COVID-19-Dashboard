- Began model experimentation with `pytorch_forecasting` in `exploratory.ipynb`. Training code largely based on (this tutorial)[https://pytorch-forecasting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/stallion.html]. Still running into problems with finding optimal learning rate - probably due to convergence (missing/unclean Data?)

- Added `requirements.txt`.
