- Applied feedback from `pytorch_forecasting` creator [Jan Beitner](https://github.com/jdb78) to fix bugs.
- Created first trained model with basic replacement of `NaNs` and no hyperparameter tuning (yet).

# 2020-11-29

- Began model experimentation with `pytorch_forecasting` in `exploratory.ipynb`. Training code largely based on [this tutorial]https://pytorch-forecasting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/stallion.html). Still running into problems with finding optimal learning rate - probably due to convergence (missing/unclean Data?)

- Added `requirements.txt`.
